This course has introduced me to mobile development which will be a useful resource in my career.

Using callbacks called listeners in mobile development is a particularly transferable skill.

Using functions to reduce the amount of repeated code was an important part of making the program maintainable and adaptable. The project was made readable using in-line comments and appropriate white space.
